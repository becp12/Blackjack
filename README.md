# BLACKJACK
This is a traditional Blackjack game. Your aim is to get dealt a hard 21 (with only 2 cards) or a soft 21 (which can be added up with any combination of 3+ cards). If you are unable to get 21, your aim is to get a higher card score than the dealer, without going above 21.  
Blackjack (21) will give you a better payout than beating the dealers number.

All number card will be worth their face value. Jack, King and Queen are all worth 10. Ace is worth 1 or 21, depending on which value will give you the better number.  

The history of Blackjack is debated whether is started in France as Vingt-et-Un (21 in French) in the 1800's. Although others believe it was first mentioned in a Spanish book written between 1602 and 1603. It was belived to be brought to America within the Klondike Gold Rush (1896-1899) or some believe it came over later, during the First World War. None of these things have been proven to be true or false, it is more speculation and no-one can be sure.

# GETTING STARTED  
[Click to play Blackjack!](https://becp12.github.io/Blackjack/)

To intiate play you must press the +$5 button until you are happy with your bet total, then select confirm bet.  

The hit button will deal another card to your hand and the stand button will allow the dealer to receive more cards to their hand. You will not be able to see the dealer's hand if you get any of the following:
- If you get 21 on your first two cards (eg. Ace & Face/10 card)
- If you get 21 over 3+ cards (eg. 4, 5, Queen, 2)
- If you bust (go over 21)
- If you get a total of 5 cards

If you do not get any of the above and decide to "stand" (stay on the number you are at with the cards you have [Note: you will not be able to get any more cards after you stand]), the dealer's second card will be revealed, their count will update and they will keep getting cards until one of the following:
- They reach 17 (they must stand if they reach between 17 & 21)
- They get 21 (with either 2 or more cards)
- They bust (go over 21)

### Payout information:  
- Blackjack pays out 3:2 (if you bet $1, you get your bet back and you get $1.50 extra  
- Player Value higher than the dealer pays out 2:1 (if you bet $1, you get your bet back and you get $1 extra)  
- Player Value and Dealer Value pays out 1:1 (if you bet $1, you get your bet back)  
- Dealer Value higher or gets 21, you lose your bet.  

# NEXT STEPS  
Potential Future Enhancements 
- Able to bet different multiples, not just $5 multiples  
- Five-Card-Charlie - win if you get to 5 cards without going over 21  
- Double down (double your bet after the hands are dealt if you think you have a good chance of winning, you will not be able to see the whole dealer hand)  
- Split (get two of the same card and you can split your hand into two hands but you also must match your bet for that hand too)
